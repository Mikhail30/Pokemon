This application will help you to call your mind about great anime Pokemon.
Lets start epic Pokemon-battles between two best amigos Ash and Brock.


## Getting Started

1.Install and open IDE on your computer (intellej idea/eclipse/ etc.), pull .java files from this repository to your installed IDE
 , add JUnit library and start the game.

OR

1.set the classpath for your JDK, like in this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVjsFFkPgbo) to have ability to run java from your command line.

2.create a folder on your computer (like Pokemons). And create bin folder in it (to separate compiled files from uncompiled files).

3.save .java files from this repository to that folder.

4.open your command line and choose your folder directory, for example C:\Javalab\Pokemon-master

5. to compile downloaded files, write a command: javac -d bin -cp company .src\com\company\Main.java. This command create in your bin folder the same name files, but with the different extension .class

6.to run these files change your directry to C:\Javalab\Pokemon-master\bin and write a command: java -cp "." Main (to transfer arguments to the program functions just write them in this command with a space between. There are thre types of argument - Object, String and int)
